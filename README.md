# Simple Python Flask starter
I use this basic app when I need to build a new Python Flask app. It's got most of the usual pieces of code I need to kick off a new project.

## How to get running with VSCode
- Clone the repo into a folder
- Run a terminal in the folder and run "python -m venv .venv"
- In the same folder run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Fire up VS Code, open the folder
- Create a Debug config and for macOS add into the args section, "--port=8000"
